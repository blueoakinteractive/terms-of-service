### 4.) Backups and Data Loss
Blue Oak Interactive backup service is provided to you as a courtesy. Blue Oak Interactive is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. Our backup service runs once a night and backups are retained based on available resources. You agree to take full responsibility for files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate backup of files and data stored on Blue Oak Interactive servers. If you would like a backup service setup that sends your files to an offsite location (ie: DropBox), Blue Oak Interactive can set this up, but you are responsible for the backups.

### 5.) Cancellations and Refunds
Blue Oak Interactive reserves the right to cancel, suspend, or otherwise restrict access to the account at any time with or without notice.

Exchange rate fluctuations for international payments are constant and unavoidable. All refunds are processed in U.S. dollars, and will reflect the exchange rate in effect on the date of the refund. All refunds are subject to this fluctuation and Blue Oak Interactive is not responsible for any change in exchange rates between time of payment and time of refund.

Customers may cancel at any time via a cancellation form. Blue Oak Interactive gives you an unconditional 45 day money back guarantee on hosted services for any customer who paid the first invoice with a credit card or with Paypal.
Cancellations requested after the initial 45 days for hosted service accounts will go into effect on the renewal date for that particular hosting package. Unless specifically requested, the account will remain active until the period expires. If the account is eligible, any request for a refund outside of the initial 45 day period will be given on a prorated basis with any previous extended term discount withheld. Refunds are to be determined once the account has been canceled. Payments older than 60 days may require a refund via PayPal or mailed check due to our merchant account policies and procedures.

There are no refunds on administrative fees, install fees for custom software or software/website development services. Refund requests for .com, .net., and .org domain names (made within the 45 day money-back guarantee period) will have the common market value subtracted for those tld's. Any ccTLD's domain name purchases are non-refundable. Please note that domain refunds will only be considered if they were ordered in conjunction with a hosting package. Eligibility of said refunds will be determined at the time of cancellation.

Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you've had an account with us before, canceled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or if you have opened a second account with us.
Violations of the Terms of Service will waive the refund policy.

### 6.) Resource Usage
User may not:
1) Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc.
2) Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.
3) Run any type of web spider or indexer (including Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared servers.
4) Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network.
5) Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal torrents off-site, but may not host or store them on our shared servers.
6) Participate in any file-sharing/peer-to-peer activities
7) Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life, battlefield1942, etc
8) Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes.
9) Run any MySQL queries longer than 15 seconds. MySQL tables should be indexed appropriately.
10) When using PHP include functions for including a local file, include the local file rather than the URL. Instead of include("http://yourdomain.com/include.php") use include("include.php")
11) To help reduce usage, do not force html to handle server-side code (like php and shtml).
12) Only use https protocol when necessary; encrypting and decrypting communications is noticeably more CPU-intensive than unencrypted communications.
If your account is exceeding our Resource Usage policy limits we may temporarily suspend your account to prevent it from affecting other customers.

### 7.) Backup Limit
Any hosted service account using more than 20 gigs of disk space will be removed from our off site weekly backup with the exception of Databases continuing to be backed up. All data will continue to be mirrored to a secondary drive which helps protect against data loss in the event of a drive failure.

### 8a.) Money back Guarantee
Each of Blue Oak Interactive’s hosting packages carry a 45 day unconditional money back guarantee on them. If you are not completely satisfied with our services within the first 45 days of your service, you will be given a full refund of the contract amount. Remember, this is only for monthly shared or reseller packages and does not apply to administrative fees, install fees for custom software, software/website development, or domain name purchases.

### 9b.) Uptime Guarantee
If your account has a physical downtime that is not within the 99% uptime you may receive up to one month of credit on your account. Approval of the credit is at the discretion of Blue Oak Interactive dependent upon justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor's network capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by other individual services. To request a credit, please contact support@blueoakinteractive.com with justification. All requests must be made in writing via email. Uptime guarantees only apply to website hosting solutions.

### 10.) Price Change
The amount you pay for hosting has been determined based on your specific website needs. If these requirements change, a price increase may be justified.
